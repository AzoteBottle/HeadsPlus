# HeadsPlus
The following is a Minecraft heads plugin. The planned functions are as followed:

- Spawn in a head as a plugin like this would (DONE)
- Add a blacklist which stops players from spawning in certain heads (DONE)
- Give mobs and players to drop their head on death event.
- Sends a player a message when a certain head is clicked (DONE)

There are many more, however I'm still threading the plugin together piece by piece.
